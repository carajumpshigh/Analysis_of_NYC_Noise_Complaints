# Analysis_of_NYC_Noise_Complaints
2019ADS final project @ NYU CUSP

## Introduction
With the introduction of the NYC Noise Code Guide, NYC residents recognized that they now have the potential to report complaints of noise to the city agencies. In recent years, the "311" department has recorded more than four hundred thousand complaints of noise alone. This project aims to discover if there exists a relationship between specific demographic characteristics in the population that would explain the tolerance in the population to report noise nuisance to the "311" department. To attend to this, we focus our work on New York City, as it's radically an immigrant city with an assorted gamut of races dwelling in it. Further ahead, we concentrate on the demographic characteristics of Age, Gender, Race as well as Education and attempt to discover patterns and correlations with reporting potential respecting NTA census tracts.
